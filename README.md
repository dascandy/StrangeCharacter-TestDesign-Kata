# Characters Test Design Kata

There are some well-marked bugs in the code. For each one:

- Create a new (empty) test case to expose the bug. Write a comment or good test name that explains what the bug is
- Write the body of the test case: it should fail because of the bug
- Fix the bug: the test case should now pass.
